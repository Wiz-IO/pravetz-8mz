## History, very briefly
for more [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravetz_computers) & Google

Pravets 8x is a complete and **improved** copy of Apple ][<br>
Pravetz 82 stands for 1982, before this name was called IMKO 1 & 2<br>
I won't discuss why it's a copy - times were like that...<br>
But I will note something else: this platform gave muse and wings to many geniuses and specialists<br>
who created the modern electronic world in which we live.<br>
Microchip PIC was chosen not by chance - it is one of the first microcontrollers widely used in Bulgaria<br>
